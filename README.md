My recent project involved creating a classic snake game using Java. This simple yet engaging game allows the player to control a snake that grows longer as it consumes food pellets, while avoiding collisions with walls and its own body. Implemented with basic Java concepts, the project focused on fundamental game development principles such as handling user input, managing game states, and rendering graphics. With its straightforward design and intuitivise gameplay, this is  a promising beginning for me, eager to explore the world of game development with Java.
